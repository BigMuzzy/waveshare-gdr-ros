# cmd_vel Timeout Safety Feature

**Added:** 2025-10-11
**Status:** ‚úÖ Implemented and tested

---

## Overview

The cmd_vel timeout watchdog is a critical safety feature that automatically stops the robot's motors if no velocity commands are received within a specified timeout period (500ms by default).

This prevents the robot from continuing to move indefinitely if communication with the controller is lost or interrupted.

---

## How It Works

### 1. Timestamp Tracking
Every time a `/cmd_vel` message is received, the current timestamp is recorded:

```cpp
// In cmd_vel_callback() - ros_com.cpp
void cmd_vel_callback(const void *msgin) {
    const geometry_msgs__msg__Twist * msg = (const geometry_msgs__msg__Twist *)msgin;
    cmd_linear_x = msg->linear.x;
    cmd_angular_z = msg->angular.z;

    // Update timestamp for timeout watchdog
    last_cmd_vel_time_ms = millis();
}
```

### 2. Timeout Checking
The main control loop checks if too much time has elapsed since the last command:

```cpp
// In loop() - main.cpp
if (state_connected) {
    // Safety check: cmd_vel timeout watchdog
    if (is_cmd_vel_timeout()) {
        // No cmd_vel received within timeout period - stop for safety
        emergency_stop();
        return;
    }

    // Normal motor control continues...
}
```

### 3. Timeout Detection
The timeout check function compares the current time against the last command time:

```cpp
// In ros_com.cpp
bool is_cmd_vel_timeout() {
    // If we've never received a command, no timeout
    if (last_cmd_vel_time_ms == 0) {
        return false;
    }

    // Check if time since last command exceeds timeout threshold
    unsigned long time_since_last_cmd = millis() - last_cmd_vel_time_ms;
    return (time_since_last_cmd > Safety::CMD_TIMEOUT_MS);
}
```

---

## Configuration

The timeout period is configured in `include/config.h`:

```cpp
namespace Safety {
    constexpr uint32_t CMD_TIMEOUT_MS = 500;  // 500ms timeout
}
```

### Changing the Timeout

To adjust the timeout period, modify the value in `config.h`:

```cpp
// Shorter timeout (more aggressive safety)
constexpr uint32_t CMD_TIMEOUT_MS = 250;  // 250ms

// Longer timeout (more lenient, for high-latency networks)
constexpr uint32_t CMD_TIMEOUT_MS = 1000;  // 1000ms (1 second)
```

**Recommended range:** 250ms - 1000ms
- Too short: May trigger false positives on slow networks
- Too long: Reduces safety effectiveness

---

## Behavior

### Normal Operation
1. Controller sends cmd_vel at regular intervals (e.g., 10Hz = every 100ms)
2. Each message resets the timeout timer
3. Robot continues normal motion

### Timeout Event
1. No cmd_vel received for > 500ms
2. `is_cmd_vel_timeout()` returns `true`
3. `emergency_stop()` is called
4. Motors immediately stop
5. Robot waits for new cmd_vel to resume

### Recovery
- As soon as a new cmd_vel is received, the timeout is cleared
- Robot resumes normal operation immediately
- No manual reset required

## Safety Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Network Interruption
```
Time    Event
0ms     Robot moving forward
100ms   cmd_vel received (v=0.5 m/s)
200ms   cmd_vel received (v=0.5 m/s)
300ms   cmd_vel received (v=0.5 m/s)
400ms   [NETWORK INTERRUPTION]
500ms   [Still moving - no timeout yet]
700ms   ‚ö†Ô∏è TIMEOUT - emergency_stop() called
800ms   Robot stopped
900ms   [Network restored]
1000ms  cmd_vel received (v=0.5 m/s) - Robot resumes
```

### Scenario 2: Controller Crash
```
Time    Event
0ms     Robot moving
100ms   cmd_vel (v=0.3)
200ms   cmd_vel (v=0.3)
300ms   [CONTROLLER PROCESS CRASHES]
600ms   ‚ö†Ô∏è TIMEOUT - motors stop automatically
        Robot remains safely stopped
```

### Scenario 3: ROS Agent Disconnect
```
Time    Event
0ms     Robot moving
100ms   cmd_vel received
200ms   [ROS agent disconnects]
        state_connected = false
        emergency_stop() called immediately (separate safety)
```

---

## Testing

### Test 1: Verify Timeout Works
```bash
# Terminal 1: Start micro-ROS agent
ros2 run micro_ros_agent micro_ros_agent serial --dev /dev/ttyUSB0 -b 115200

# Terminal 2: Send single command and observe
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2}}" --once

# Expected: Robot moves for ~500ms then stops automatically
```

### Test 2: Continuous Commands (No Timeout)
```bash
# Send commands at 10Hz (every 100ms) - well within timeout
ros2 topic pub /cmd_vel geometry_msgs/Twist "{linear: {x: 0.2}}" -r 10

# Expected: Robot continues moving smoothly
# Stop: Ctrl+C, robot will stop after 500ms
```

### Test 3: Adjust Timeout Value
```bash
# Modify config.h: CMD_TIMEOUT_MS = 250
# Rebuild and upload
pio run --target upload

# Test with same commands - timeout should trigger faster
```

## Code Files Modified

| File | Changes |
|------|---------|
| `src/ros_com.cpp` | Added `last_cmd_vel_time_ms` variable, updated `cmd_vel_callback()`, added `is_cmd_vel_timeout()` function |
| `src/ros_com.h` | Added `is_cmd_vel_timeout()` declaration with documentation |
| `src/main.cpp` | Added timeout check in main control loop with `emergency_stop()` |
| `include/config.h` | Already had `Safety::CMD_TIMEOUT_MS = 500` defined |

## Integration with Other Safety Features

The cmd_vel timeout works alongside other safety mechanisms:

1. **ROS Agent Disconnect**
   - `state_connected == false` ‚Üí immediate emergency stop
   - cmd_vel timeout only active when connected

2. **Motor Enable Flag**
   - `/ugv/motor_enable` can disable motors
   - cmd_vel timeout is additional independent safety

3. **Emergency Stop Button**
   - Hardware e-stop (if implemented) overrides all control

### Safety Priority
```
Highest Priority: Hardware E-Stop (if present)
             ‚Üì
        ROS Agent Disconnect (state_connected)
             ‚Üì
        Motor Enable Flag (motor_enabled)
             ‚Üì
        cmd_vel Timeout (is_cmd_vel_timeout)
             ‚Üì
Lowest Priority: Normal Motor Control
```

## Performance Impact

- **CPU Overhead:** Minimal (~1 ¬µs per loop iteration)
- **Memory:** 4 bytes (uint32_t timestamp variable)
- **Latency:** None (non-blocking check)

The timeout check is extremely lightweight and has negligible impact on system performance.

---

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: Motors stop unexpectedly
**Possible Causes:**
1. cmd_vel publishing rate < 2Hz (too slow)
2. Network latency > 500ms
3. Controller not publishing consistently

**Solutions:**
- Increase publishing rate to at least 10Hz
- Increase `CMD_TIMEOUT_MS` if network is slow
- Check controller is running: `ros2 topic hz /cmd_vel`

### Issue: Timeout doesn't trigger
**Check:**
1. Verify timeout is compiled in (check main.cpp:55)
2. Confirm `Safety::CMD_TIMEOUT_MS` is set correctly
3. Ensure robot is connected (`state_connected == true`)

### Issue: Timeout triggers immediately
**Check:**
- First cmd_vel must be received before timeout starts
- If `last_cmd_vel_time_ms == 0`, no timeout occurs
- Send at least one cmd_vel to initialize

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements for future versions:

1. **Configurable via ROS Parameter**
   - Allow runtime timeout adjustment via ROS parameter server
   - `/ugv/safety/cmd_vel_timeout` parameter

2. **Timeout Warning Topic**
   - Publish warnings before timeout triggers
   - `/ugv/safety/timeout_warning` (std_msgs/Bool)

3. **Gradual Deceleration**
   - Instead of emergency stop, gradually slow down
   - More comfortable for passengers

4. **Different Timeouts for Different States**
   - Shorter timeout when moving fast
   - Longer timeout when nearly stopped
